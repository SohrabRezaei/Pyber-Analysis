# Pyber_Challenge

## Overview of the analysis

* Creating a new dataframe based on type of city for a ride sharing company. Total rides, total drivers, total fare,average fare per ride and average fare per driver is collected in this dataframe as a summmary for pyber. Then, I create a chart to display the total fares of each city type weekly with [resample] (https://www.pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.resample.html) method.
